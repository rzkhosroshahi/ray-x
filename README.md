# Ray-x

This is a Node.js server that serves static files and handles client-side routing for a Single Page Application (SPA). This is an experimental project.

## How it works?

In every navigation by window history object client make an POST request to server and it respons with a pre-defined html content and finally it will append to #root element. so simple : )
